# Emergency Goods Distribution Model
This repository contains implementations and presentation materials on my high school science project (2016 - 2017). As this project had been gradually developed and participated in several competitions, there are mainly 3 implementations:

* **MWITS Science Fair**

This version was presented at the annual school's science fair. Motivated by major flooding in Thailand in 2011, I have simplified emergency goods distribution into a discrete-time mathematical model. A greedy algorithm and a penalty function were designed to find a good solution.

* **Young Scientist Competition 2017**

This version was presented in the [Young Scientist Competition](http://fic.nectec.or.th/abstract_ysc_MainPage) and won the second prize. While it is similar to the previous version, presentation materials were modified to conform with the competition's format.

* **Intel ISEF 2017**

This version was presented at the [Intel International Science and Engineering Fair (Intel ISEF) 2017](https://www.societyforscience.org/isef/intel-isef-2017/). It features more flexible a mathematical model and adopts a Genetic Algorithm with variable chromosome length to find a good solution. The abstract is available [here](https://abstracts.societyforscience.org/Home/PrintPdf/8808).
